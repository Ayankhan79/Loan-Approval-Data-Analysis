# **LOAN APPROVAL DATA ANALYSIS 🏦💰**
##  📊 **EDA Project**

In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a loan approval dataset to understand the factors that influence the **Loan_Status**. I began by exploring the dataset’s structure - i.e checking **data types**, separating **numerical and categorical** columns, and identifying **missing values**. This initial step helped me understand the dataset and prepare it for proper analysis.

I then cleaned the data by handling missing and inconsistent entries using **median** and **mode imputation**, and ensured each feature had the correct data type. After cleaning, I performed **univariate analysis** to explore the distribution of each column. I used **histograms, boxplots, countplots**, and **Plotly interactive visualizations** to study patterns, detect **outliers**, and identify **skewed** numerical features.

The most important part of the project was the **bivariate analysis**, where I compared each feature with **Loan_Status** to understand what affects loan approval. I analyzed relationships between the target and features like **Gender, Married status, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area, ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount**, and especially **Credit_History**. One major insight was that **Credit_History is the strongest predictor** of loan approval in this dataset.

I also generated a **correlation heatmap** to study how numerical features relate to each other and to check for **multicollinearity**. Additionally, I created useful engineered features such as **Total Income**, **EMI**, and **Income-to-Loan Ratio**, which help provide deeper insights for future modeling.

# 🎯 **What I Learned**

From this EDA project, I learned how to:

* Clean and preprocess real-world datasets
* Handle **missing values**, **outliers**, and **skewed distributions**
* Perform **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis**
* Create clear visual insights using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
* Understand feature relationships using **correlation analysis**
* Engineer new features that improve data understanding

Overall, this project strengthened my ability to explore datasets effectively and understand insights clearly,exactly like what is expected from a data analyst or data scientist.
